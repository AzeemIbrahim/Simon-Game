<h1>Simon Game</h1>



This is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon Game, built using JavaScript and jQuery.

## Getting Started

To play the game, simply visit the live demo at  https://azeemibrahim.github.io/Simon-Game/ .

Alternatively, you can clone this repository and run the game locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

To run the game locally, you will need a web browser and a text editor. You can use any web browser, but we recommend using the latest version of Google Chrome for the best experience.

### Installing

To install the game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/AzeemIbrahim/Simon-Game.git`
2. Open the index.html file in your web browser
3. Play the game!

## How to Play

The goal of the game is to repeat a sequence of colors and sounds that Simon (the computer) plays. Each time you successfully repeat the sequence, Simon will add another color and sound to the end of the sequence. If you make a mistake, Simon will sound a buzz to indicate that you have lost the game.

To start the game, simply click on the "Start" button. Simon will play a sequence of colors and sounds. Your goal is to repeat the sequence by clicking  on the colors using trackpad or keyboard in the same order that Simon played them.

Once you successfully repeat the sequence, Simon will add another color and sound to the end of the sequence. The game will continue in this manner until you make a mistake or reach a score of 20.
